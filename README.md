# starling
A simulation of collective behaviour, e.g. starling flocks in winter.

A number of the results, also used for the presentation, are here in MP4 format.

Mode 3 contains the shark result. Note that we experimented with the parameters to determine that the initial conditions for the blue fish are stable; they do not form a collective behaviour phase. However, the perturbation added in the form of the Shark does induce a phase change to the collective behaviour phase.

Therefore, we called the Project: "Shark-induced Phase Transitions".
